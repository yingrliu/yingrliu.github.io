# About Me

I am currently a 6th-year Phd student on Machine Learning in Stony Brook Univeristy (SBU). 
I concentrates on designing reusable deep generative models for capturing the stochasticity and 
dynamics of sequential data. Before that, I received Bachelor degree of Automation Control from 
University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).

I have a broad range of interest and curiosity in research. Learning brings me a lot of happiness both inside and outside the academics. If you think we could work together for some challenging works, I am glad to learn from you.
