# About Me

I am currently a Research Scientist in Facebook Reality Lab (FRL) - CTRL Team [[link]](https://tech.fb.com/inside-facebook-reality-labs-wrist-based-interaction-for-the-next-computing-platform/).
Prior to Facebook, I earned Phd on Computer Engineering in Stony Brook Univeristy (SBU).
I concentrates on designing reusable deep generative models for capturing the stochasticity and
dynamics of time series. Before that, I received Bachelor degree of Automation Control from
University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).

I have a broad range of interest and curiosity in research. Learning brings me a lot of happiness in both academics and life. If you think we could learn from each other, feel free to reach out~~~ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†
