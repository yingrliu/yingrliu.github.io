# About Me

I am currently a Senior Research Scientist in Meta's Generative AI team working on advanced speech generation technique.
Before that, I have spent three years in Facebook Reality Lab (FRL) - CTRL Team <a href="https://tech.fb.com/inside-facebook-reality-labs-wrist-based-interaction-for-the-next-computing-platform/" target="_blank">[link]</a>, where I was working on studying advanced machine learning models to create user-friendly neural-motor interface.
Prior to Facebook, I earned Phd on Computer Engineering in Stony Brook Univeristy (SBU),
where I concentrated on designing reusable deep generative models for capturing the stochasticity and
dynamics of time series. Before that, I received Bachelor degree of Automation Control from
University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) with solid background on robust adaptive control.

I have a broad range of interest and curiosity. Learning brings me a lot of happiness in both academics and life.

# Services

I have served as peer reviewers in renowned conferences such as `ACM Multimedia 2022 ~ 2024` and `ICLR 2022 Workshop: Elements of Reasoning: Objects, Structure, and Causality`.
I have also worked as peer reviewers in AI/ML domains for some famous engineering journals such as `IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing`,
`IEEE Access`, `IEEE Intelligent Systems` and `Pattern Recognition`.
